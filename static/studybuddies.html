    StudyBuddies is a web application to help students find others to study with
    and to develop study habits. Sometimes students don't know others in some of the
    classes that they're taking. StudyBuddies aims to remedy this by allowing people
    to connect, meet and study. Students can add classes they're taking to automatically
    search for study groups. if no study groups are available, students can create one.
